# Updatecheck
- Version 1.0.0
.
- The idea is simpel, it checks the mod.json file on github
- after reading the local version.lua file, what contains the local version it compares it.
- if there is a change it reads the Reason string and post it in the console.
- THIS part works as it should be.
- This can be false or true
- This extended version has a option that should be useable ingame by invoke the !mod command
- And should post the same output in the chat screen.
